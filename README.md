# Hi, I'm Unni T A 👋

Full-Stack Developer | MERN Stack Enthusiast | AI Integration Learner

I'm a self-taught developer from Ernakulam, Kerala, India, with a focus on building web applications using modern technologies. My projects are prototypes designed to explore full-stack development and AI features, helping me gain practical experience. I'm eager to contribute to real-world teams and am open to remote junior roles in full-stack development.

## Skills
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Firebase
- **AI/ML**: Basic integrations with Google Gemini/Genkit for recommendations and parsing
- **Tools**: Git, Vercel deployments, Snyk for security, JWT authentication, Socket.io
- **Other**: Responsive design, basic testing with Vitest, CI/CD via GitHub Actions

These skills come from hands-on prototyping; I'm building depth through ongoing practice.
